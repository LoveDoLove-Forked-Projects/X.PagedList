## What is this?
The X.PagedList.EF6 library provides Entity Framework (Version 6) extensions for the X.PagedList library, enabling easier 
paging through data collections within Entity Framework contexts. This extension facilitates the creation of paged 
lists from IQueryable collections, streamlining the process of managing large datasets in .NET applications.
